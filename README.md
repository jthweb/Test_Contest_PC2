Update your **system `PATH`** with:

```
C:\pc2\pc2-9.11build\bin
C:\pc2\pc2-9.11build\projects\WebTeamInterface-1.2\bin
C:\pc2\kotlinc\bin
C:\pc2\pypy3.11-v7.3.20-win64\

## 🚀 Contest Launch Guide

### 1. Start the Server

```sh
cd C:\pc2\TestContest\config
pc2server --load "C:\pc2\TestContest\config"
```

- Login: `site1` / `site1`
- Set and remember a **contest password**

### 2. Launch the Admin Panel

```sh
pc2admin
```

- Login: `root` / `administrator1`
- Verify CDP-loaded:
  - Problems
  - Groups
  - Languages

Edit and verify:
- **Problems → Edit**
- **Languages tab**
- **Times → Site1 → Edit Start Time or Start Contest**

### 3. Start Judge Panel

```sh
pc2judge
```

- Login: `judge1` / `judge1`

### 4. Start Web Team Interface (WTI)

```sh
cd C:\pc2\pc2-9.11build\projects\WebTeamInterface
pc2wti
```

Then open: [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)

- Login using username and password `teamx` / `teamx` (where x is team number)

And that's all! The server is set! Now start the contest from the admin panel by clicking on the `Times` tab and click on the site you want to start. You can also additionally change the start and end times to your system time, rather than manually starting and ending the contest.

### 5. Resolve the Contest

Go to the "Reports" tab from an "administrator" account or from the "server".
Select the "Results Export Files"
from the "Reports" pull-down list, then press the "Export Report Contents" button. A window will pop up showing you
where it created the reports, for example:

```
pc2 results dir : reports\report.Results_Export_Files.06.18.126.txt.files
Contest finalized : No. (Warning - contest is not finalized)
Wrote results files to:
reports\report.Results_Export_Files.06.18.126.txt.files\results.tsv
reports\report.Results_Export_Files.06.18.126.txt.files\scoreboard.json
reports\report.Results_Export_Files.06.18.126.txt.files\awards.json
reports\report.Results_Export_Files.06.18.126.txt.files\event-feed.ndjson
```

If you are not using the nightly build, you'll have to generate 2 reports: the "Event Feed JSON" report and the "awards
JSON" report.

```sh 
cd C:\pc2\resolver
resolver.bat C:\pc2\TestContest\resolver
```

Follow the guide from ICPC for using the resolver 

> 📝 Note:  Make sure to adjust the path of the resolver based on where you exported the finalized data.

Congrats! You have successfully hosted your first contest using PC²!
