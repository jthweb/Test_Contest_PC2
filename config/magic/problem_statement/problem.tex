\problemtitle{The Magic Garden}

In a magical garden, there are N flowers arranged in a straight line. Each flower has a unique height represented by an integer. The garden is enchanted, and the flowers can only be watered if they are in a strictly increasing order of height. Your task is to determine the maximum number of flowers that can be watered in a single operation.

You can choose any flower as the starting point and can only move to the right to water the next flower if its height is greater than the last watered flower.
Input

    The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), the number of flowers.
    The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the heights of the flowers.

Output

    Print a single integer, the maximum number of flowers that can be watered.

Example

Input
1 3 2 5 4 6 7
