\problemtitle{The Matrix Problem}

You are given two matrices, A and B, of dimensions M x N. Your task is to compute the sum of the two matrices and output the resulting matrix.
Input

    The first line contains two integers M and N (1 ≤ M, N ≤ 100), representing the number of rows and columns of the matrices.
    The next M lines contain N space-separated integers representing the elements of matrix A.
    The following M lines contain N space-separated integers representing the elements of matrix B.

Output

    Print the resulting matrix after summing matrices A and B, with each row on a new line.
